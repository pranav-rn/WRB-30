# WRB-30
A line follower robot with obstacle detection
This project implements an autonomous navigation system on a Raspberry Pi platform integrating infrared array sensors, ultrasonic distance sensor, and MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope. The primary aim is to create a robot capable of precise line following while simultaneously monitoring its surroundings and movement characteristics. The system uses a five-sensor IR array for line detection and tracking through a bang-bang control algorithm, while the ultrasonic sensor provides forward obstacle detection. Motion data from the MPU-6050 enables velocity estimation and movement analysis. The integrated system prioritizes line following functionality while periodically collecting and processing sensor data, displaying real-time distance measurements and acceleration metrics without compromising navigation performance. This balanced approach enables reliable autonomous guidance with enhanced environmentalÂ awareness.
